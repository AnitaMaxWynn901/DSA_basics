# Data Structures and Algorithms Course

This repository contains my coursework, implementations, and assignments from my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course.

## 📚 Course Overview

This collection demonstrates fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts through practical Java implementations and problem-solving exercises.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

### Core Implementations (`src/`)

The source directory contains implementations of various data structures:

- **Array-based Structures**
  - `ArrayQueue.java` - Queue implementation using arrays
  - `ArrayStack.java` - Stack implementation using arrays
  - `ArrayStackChar.java` - Character-specific stack

- **Linked List Structures**
  - `CLL.java` - Circular Linked List
  - `SLL.java` - Singly Linked List

- **Hash Tables**
  - `HashTable.java` - Hash table implementation
  - `HashTable2.java` - Alternative hash table approach

- **Advanced Topics**
  - `Infix2Postfix.java` - Expression conversion
  - `SimpleRecursion.java` - Recursion examples
  - `Matching.java` - Pattern matching algorithms

- **Application Examples**
  - `Blackjack.java` - Card game implementation
  - `Classroom.java` - Management system
  - `Shop.java` - Shopping system
